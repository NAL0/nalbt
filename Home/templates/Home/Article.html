<h1>
Why nuclear power is unsuitable for use in South Africa
</h1>

<p>
While nuclear power is very efficient at generating large amounts of energy, aside from being
hazardous in the case of a meltdown, it requires large amounts of water to cool the reactor.
South Afrika is a semi-arid country meaning that it is dry, thus it lacks water.
